# JPA-project
Web application which uses JPA and relational database.

This web application is a prototype of a telecommunication company's website to emulate the creation and purchase of custom subscriptions for different services. The web app mainly focused on the development of the JPA and allows the signup and log of two kinds of users: client and employee, through which different functions can be used. The database (MySQL) includes triggers to manage the materialized views which are tables in the database itself.

The Server used to run the project is Apache Tomcat and the application was developed using Eclipse.
